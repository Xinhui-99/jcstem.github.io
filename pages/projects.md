The JC STEM Lab of MediaML @ HKU, in its pursuit of advancing intelligence and machine learning technologies, has solidified an extensive network of collaborative partnerships.

**Government Collaborations**:
Our longstanding relationship with government agencies has not only facilitated crucial research grants and funding but has also ensured that our innovations align with the nation's strategic priorities. This symbiotic relationship has led to the development of solutions addressing public sector challenges and has positioned our research in the heart of policy-making discussions.

**Industry Partnerships**:
Collaboration with companies serves a dual purpose. First, it allows us to translate our academic research into real-world applications, ensuring that our innovations find their rightful place in the market. Second, it provides our researchers with invaluable insights into industry needs, trends, and challenges, ensuring our research remains both relevant and applicable.

**Inter-Laboratory Synergy**:
By fostering relationships with other cutting-edge laboratories worldwide, we've embraced a culture of knowledge exchange and mutual growth. These partnerships facilitate shared resources, joint research projects, and an expanded pool of expertise. The fusion of diverse perspectives and methodologies drives us to challenge boundaries and redefine what's possible in our domain.
